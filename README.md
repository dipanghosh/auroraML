# AuroraML
Machine Learning model for recognizing aurora in all sky images

## Summary
I am fascinated by the Aurora lightshow. So I went around looking for footage and cams that capture the spectacle. One particular of interest was the Syowa All Sky camera in the south pole. There is a data archive or over a decade worth of data. It is really not feasible to look through it for intense aurora activity, so I put together a ML pipeline for doing basic mage recognition. The selectivity threshold was kept low to avoid any false negatives. In general, we ended up with a good selection, but with some false positives.
